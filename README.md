**Curated and well-maintained hosts files to block social media, trackers, porn sites &amp; ads.**


### &#9755; What is host file?

A hosts file is a plain-text file used by all operating systems to map hostnames to IP addresses. Host file is preferred over DNS so if a domain name is resolved by the hosts file, the request never leaves your computer.
