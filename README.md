# Hosts

**Curated and well-maintained hosts files to block social media, trackers, porn ads &amp; sites.**


### &#9755; What is host file?

A hosts file is a plain-text file used by all operating systems to map hostnames to IP addresses. Host file is preferred over DNS so if a domain name is resolved by the hosts file, the request never leaves your computer.


### &#9755; Usage :

Add following host files to **DNS Filters** or **Adaway** (rooted only) to block respective domains.
